Description: This package provides a pipeline to generally
    optimize single and multi-objective problems on continuous design spaces.
    The package is built to run standard kriging MBO for problems as well as
    utilizing dropout methods when the design space has high dimension.
    Alternative methods for high dimensional optimization are under development.
