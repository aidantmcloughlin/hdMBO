## NOTE: Still in development.

This package provides tools to run Gaussian Process model-based optimization 
on high-dimensional continuous design spaces.  Currently, the high-dimensional 
cases can only be handled via parameter dropout as described by 
[Li et al, 2018](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1802/1802.05400.pdf).
